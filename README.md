# Catullus
Brief Description: Literary analysis using R for the Roman author Catullus

This repository provides code that was used to explor the Latin and English versions of Catullus' Lesbia poems. 
Using Stylometry and Sentiment Analysis, I determined how similar A) The Lesbia poems were to his other works, and B) How similar the Lesbia poems were to each other.
The results of my findings are published in a research paper written for The University of Virginia course ENEC 3559 ("Hacking the Humanist"), which is not posted here.
